# opsdir-adapter-aws

opsdir adapter for Amazon Web Services: Terraform for AWS environments and aws-sm:// secret references.

Applies to environments whose cloud has `ciamCloudProvider: aws`. Renders the environment-specific Terraform (VPC, subnets, instances, load balancers, security groups, DNS) and resolves `aws-sm://` secret references with the AWS CLI at run time. Owns the reference schemes `aws-sm` (Secrets Manager), `aws-kms` (KMS keys), `aws-acm` (certificates in Certificate Manager), `s3`.

## Reading an environment back from Terraform state

```bash
terraform -chdir=… state pull > export/source/prod/terraform.tfstate     # one folder per <cloud>/<env>
opsdir import --dry-run aws/terraform-state export/                        # what the live environment differs in
opsdir import --change CHG-… aws/terraform-state export/                   # record it
```

The importer `aws/terraform-state` reads Terraform state (format version 4; managed resources and data sources) into the environment's servers and bindings: the VPC (`network`), subnets, instances (name, role, hostname and product from their tags `Name`, `Role`, `Hostname`, `Product`; the subnet they are in), each network load balancer with its listeners, targets and the Route 53 record aliasing it (a service name: DNS name, zone, ports, the role it targets, its private address or Elastic IP), security group ingress rules (grouped into the record's firewall rules by the name their descriptions end with, `(fw-name)`, or their tag `Name`; the target role is that of the instances in the group), Secrets Manager secrets (as `aws-sm://` references, with rotation), KMS keys (rotation, replica regions), the S3 bucket (`s3://`) and NAT gateways (egress addresses).

What the state says replaces the record's values for what it covers; everything else on the entry is kept. A resource the record doesn't have is added when its tags name its role (`Role`) or the environment's role map `roles.json` does (a JSON object of provider references or names to roles, beside the state: `export/<cloud>/<env>/roles.json`; the tag wins where both give one), and named in the notices otherwise; so is an entry the record has that the state doesn't. An overlay environment leaves its base's bindings alone. Secret values in the state (`aws_secretsmanager_secret_version`, generated passwords, anything the state marks sensitive) are never read.

## Reading an environment from the AWS CLI

Where there is no Terraform state (or to check it against what the account actually runs), `aws/cli-inventory` reads the JSON the AWS CLI prints. Collect it once per environment, into one folder per `<cloud>/<env>`:

```bash
out=export/source/prod; VPC=vpc-0a1b2c3d4e5f67890              # the environment's VPC scopes what is read
mkdir -p $out/target-health $out/route53 $out/kms
aws ec2 describe-vpcs --vpc-ids $VPC                                   > $out/vpcs.json
aws ec2 describe-subnets --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC             > $out/subnets.json
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC           > $out/instances.json
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC     > $out/security-groups.json
aws ec2 describe-security-group-rules                                  > $out/security-group-rules.json   # optional: tags per rule
aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways --filter Name=vpc-id,Values=$VPC         > $out/nat-gateways.json
aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers                                      > $out/load-balancers.json
aws elbv2 describe-target-groups                                       > $out/target-groups.json
for lb in $(aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --query 'LoadBalancers[].LoadBalancerArn' --output text); do
  aws elbv2 describe-listeners --load-balancer-arn "$lb"               > "$out/listeners-${lb##*/}.json"
  aws elbv2 describe-tags --resource-arns "$lb"                        > "$out/lb-tags-${lb##*/}.json"
done
for tg in $(aws elbv2 describe-target-groups --query 'TargetGroups[].TargetGroupArn' --output text); do
  name=${tg#*targetgroup/}; name=${name%%/*}                           # the file is named by the target group
  aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn "$tg"            > "$out/target-health/$name.json"
done
for zone in $(aws route53 list-hosted-zones --query 'HostedZones[].Id' --output text); do
  aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id "${zone##*/}" > "$out/route53/${zone##*/}.json"   # named by zone ID
done
aws secretsmanager list-secrets                                        > $out/secrets.json
for key in $(aws kms list-keys --query 'Keys[].KeyId' --output text); do
  aws kms describe-key --key-id "$key"                                 > "$out/kms/key-$key.json"
  aws kms get-key-rotation-status --key-id "$key"                      > "$out/kms/rotation-$key.json"
done
aws s3api list-buckets                                                 > $out/buckets.json

opsdir import --dry-run aws/cli-inventory export/
opsdir import --change CHG-… aws/cli-inventory export/
```

File names are free except two: `describe-target-health` and `list-resource-record-sets` don't say what they describe, so they are saved as `target-health/<target group name>.json` and `route53/<hosted zone ID>.json`. Every other output is recognized by its top-level key (`Vpcs`, `Subnets`, `Reservations`, `SecurityGroups`, `SecurityGroupRules`, `NatGateways`, `LoadBalancers`, `TagDescriptions`, `Listeners`, `TargetGroups`, `SecretList`, `KeyMetadata`, `KeyRotationEnabled`, `Buckets`); anything else is named and skipped.

The outputs are read into the same resources as Terraform state (the mapping is shared), so matching, what changes, roles and `roles.json` work the same way. What the CLI adds: a secret's last rotation (`ciamLastRotated`) and that rotation is off (`ciamAutoRotate: FALSE`), which state doesn't hold. Differences in scope:

- **Network resources** (subnets, instances, security groups, load balancers, NAT gateways) are read only inside the VPCs `describe-vpcs` lists; others are counted. Terminated instances are skipped.
- **Account-wide listings** (secrets, KMS keys, buckets) report far more than one environment: the ones the record doesn't have and nothing names a role for are counted with a few examples, not listed one by one. Name the ones that belong in `roles.json` (by ARN or name). Only customer managed KMS keys are read; AWS managed keys are counted.
- `list-secrets` never returns secret values, and nothing reads `get-secret-value` output.

## Reading an environment from its CloudFormation stacks

Where the environment is managed with CloudFormation, `aws/cloudformation` reads its stacks: one folder per stack under `<cloud>/<env>/` (any folder name), holding what the CLI prints for the stack and its template:

```bash
for stack in ciam-prod-network ciam-prod-app; do
  d=export/source/prod/$stack; mkdir -p $d
  aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $stack       > $d/stack.json       # parameters, region, account
  aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name $stack  > $d/resources.json   # physical IDs
  aws cloudformation get-template --stack-name $stack          > $d/template.json    # or copy the template file itself
done
opsdir import --dry-run aws/cloudformation export/
```

The template says what each resource is declared with; the stack's resources give the IDs the record matches on (`vpc-…`, `i-…`, ARNs), so a stack without its resource listing is read for nothing and named. Values are resolved from the stack's parameters (else the template's defaults), pseudo parameters (`AWS::Region`, `AWS::AccountId`, … from the stack ID) and physical IDs: `Ref`, `Fn::Sub`, `Fn::Join`, `Fn::Select`, and `Fn::GetAtt` where it links resources (a Route 53 alias to its load balancer, a NAT gateway or load balancer to its Elastic IP's address). JSON and YAML templates are read, short tags (`!Ref`, `!Sub`, `!GetAtt`, …) included.

What the stacks declare is read into the same resources as Terraform state (the mapping is shared: VPCs, subnets, instances, security groups and ingress rules, load balancers with listeners and target groups, alias records, Secrets Manager secrets with rotation schedules, KMS keys, S3 buckets, NAT gateways), so matching, roles and `roles.json` work the same way. A KMS key's rotation is off unless the template sets `EnableKeyRotation`, as in CloudFormation. Named in the notices:

- functions that aren't evaluated (`Fn::If`, `Fn::ImportValue`, `Fn::FindInMap`, `Fn::Cidr`, …), counted per stack: the attributes computed with them keep the record's values;
- resources without a physical ID (not created, failed, deleted) and resource types not read, counted;
- values only the running resource knows that the template doesn't declare (an instance's address when the template leaves it to AWS) keep the record's values.

A secret's `SecretString`, `SecretBinary` and `GenerateSecretString` are dropped before anything is resolved; `NoEcho` parameters come back from `describe-stacks` masked.

Installing the package registers it with opsdir (entry point `opsdir.adapters`: `aws`); nothing in the opsdir core changes. In this repository: `scripts/dev-install.sh`.
